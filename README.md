### Bugs and problems: üêû

- [ ] If you type in E.g. "red" into the search bar words like discoveRED will be displayed. Also non-english words will show up e.g. the german word "REDen" if you type in red as the search again.

### To-Do list: (Things that I want to add as a functionality)

- [ ] Implement multi threading for faster results (Iterating over 500 videos takes way too long)

--> Note: Here is my google colab file where I was able to increase the data fetching part by 500% using multi threading and code run in parallel
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i5dHBNwIw8iV2kTg_LnKOrT_fIT3DtMI?usp=sharing

- [ ] Implement a cache where results are stored, so that the user don't need to fetch every video again if he/she wants to search a different word
- [ ] Being able to search the entire YouTube channel. For demonstration purposes I only indexed 30 videos because my iterative algorithm is too slow for now
- [ ] Add 50 YouTube channels
- [ ] I have to extract and add the video IDs from each video manually. Some do not have a transcript available. So some sort of automation task would be great

Notes to myself: 

- This is the code for fetching all the IDs of a YouTube channel

--> https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rlverbo9tYslhXyvKMQh591u6MylJWLu?usp=sharing

- My code works for YouTube videos that are set to "only visible by link". So one can simply mirror an entire channel, set every video to "only accessible by link" and then even deleted videos from the original channel will still be searchable
